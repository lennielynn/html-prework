                <h2>A Little On Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Lyla Guthrie, I am 18 years old, and I am from the Lowcountry of South Carolina. <br> I come from a large family of nine and we have moved all 
                    across the country. From Texas to Montana weve been all over contenental America. As a family we had some awesome adventures, and because of this we are decently close knit and have quite the crazy stories. 
                    Because of my frequent moving from an early age, I have a gigantic love for travel and an extreme love for culture, one of the reasons I am going into software engineering is so I can continue to travel even as I work! 
                    I have quite a few hobbies that consist of physical and artistic activities, such as, martial arts, drawing, weight lifting, music, long boarding, gaming with friends,
                     and poetry! Iâ€™ve always loved learning new things and gaining new experiences, and I am always very down for whatever which has led me to have a very diverse set of skills, and group of friends. 
                    I am extremely blessed and extremely grateful for all God has blessed me with throughout my life, and I can't wait to add more memories and experiences!</p>

                <h2>My Happy Things</h2>
                <strong>Hobbies</strong>
                <p>If you know me well enough or long enouh it will become very apparent that choosing only a hand-full of things I enjoy would be an impossible task to say the least. My love for new experience has delt me quite the hand of hobbies
                    to put it vaguely. I find joy to its most extreme extent while learning and expanding my mind, and I do my best to find the fun route in the most simple of activities, but I'll try and only mention a few. Some of my hobbies are
                     cars, weight lifting, drawing and writing, video games, music (playing and lisening), movies, and photography! It is my greatest hope to grow this list of hobbies with the people who I care about and to add a few people to my 
                     circle along the way.

                <p>In life, we are given things that are consistantly a blessing, things that, seemigly, you could never live without. In my life God has given me my family, while we are by no means perfect
                    and we have out days/moments to be certian, but this group of people are the craziest and most necessary aspect of my world and I couldn't attempt to design something about myself without aknowledging them. 
                    As mentioned before, we've had some pretty crazy experiences, and have seen the Lord do some pretty amazing things. As life goes on and we continue to experience the crazy things of mundane life as we know it,
                     I can always know I've got people looking out for me.

                <h2>Why A Developer?</h2>
                <strong>A few Among Many Reasons</strong>
                <p>There are quite a few reasons I've chosen to enter into the field of software development, the more extreme few of those being that I have always loved technology and computer science, I wanted to enter into a workforce where 
                    I could opperate remotely, and I genuinely enjoy coding. In a world where technology is not becoming any less necesary any time soon I don't see a better role to fill then the one who provides the operationg systems for that tech.
                     Over-all I love the work itslef, and I see it as a necessary part of the worlds work-force, providing me with the job security I desire. </p>
